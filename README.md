# JavaScript-And-HTML5
Using JavaScript &amp; HTML5 Canvas to Expand and Contract upon Image Processes

Advantageous JSON, JS, & HTML5 Canvas Image Loading Technique (Beneficial for Lazy-Loading, File Size Reduction, Client-Side Control & Server-Side Control) - Standard Proposal (Accept as Dynamic-Form Class then Containing in Form such Data.) [File Size Comparison: JPG, PNG, JSON(Color Map, Dimensionally-Positioned Color-Map-Reference)]

If we develop, I think prototype is such class I would be referencing at - if I knew enough, such a class which a set of standard forms are then conjoined are parsed from such that we would structure possibly like;

Object.Begin = "{"
Array.Begin = "["
Value.Object = ":"
Value.Array = ","
Array.Close = "]"
Object.Close = "}"

We could pass objects as formed formless representations (As Dynamic is required to give rise to Static, and Static is required to give rise to Dynamic...hence, binary forms requirement...);

"{[:,]}
[[[0,0,0,1],[255,255,255,1]],[[0,1,0,1],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]]" as "test.data" which could be reformed and parsed with the same dynamic-parsing into static units...

"{(:;)}
(((0;0;0;1);(255;255;255;1));((0;1;0;1);(1;0;1;0);(0;1;0;1);(1;0;1;0)))" as "test.data" which would be equivalent to preceding "test.data"
or
"[[[0,0,0,1],[255,255,255,1]],[[0,1,0,1],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]]" as "test.json"
"(((0;0;0;1);(255;255;255;1));((0;1;0;1);(1;0;1;0);(0;1;0;1);(1;0;1;0)))" as "test.json" as reformattable by either "test.data(0)" or "test.data(1)"

There idea aloofs to an idea that such forms are inherently meaningless, a logical fallacy; as what is regarded as meaningless is symbolically linked henceforth, normally a degree of segregation more-so, to a depth which is rather shallow and needy. (I mean to say, we could use any symbols other than those used within the defined types internally, but as far as the need to have such a degree of control - I feel actually drastically destroys the actual need and intention - and over time has been a dagger in the foot - with more note needs than required.)

Also; as since the majority of image data is re-handled and re-painted and re-... repeatedly - the need to reduce the transferance quantity, it seems, is naturally more precedent than the need to - as we do by standard (which I likely do not fully grasp and understand...,) to me makes more sense to at most only parse to an extent of color and position cross-referencing...this holds a merit of what I consider a tactfully named; "User-End To-View Image Processing Procedure," which minimizes each Ends' Storage Costs, while decreasing Host Processing Cost - for the Lowering (compred to current...) of User-End Processing Costs...

Since almost EACH Image format is a conglomerate of Pixelated Color Data (normally some Quanterny vector,) and Poisitional Reference to which Color is at give location (2D, 3D,...coordinates in form of Vector Array referencing such,) alongside some Functional or Mathematical named procedure instruction set - either post or pre-hence a view;

Then with the avilability of such system that could deliver directly - and internal operational setting capability (Browser-Optional Image/Site*Image Quality Control Mechanics) then the overall lowering of processing and data costs that is our current mechanism - is rather laggish as far as programmer and developer, true, and less advantageous outside such realms? No, rahter - is the cost and change going to drive seperation between all parties? (True, backwards compatibility has more than one reason.)

Honestly - Browser end support for Uploading Image through a Browser-Handled Conversion process, although wordie, could sufficely ease such complications.

I may need to expose myself to more Python - as nesting with symbolic enclosures can in fact be avoided.

Anyhow - I am adding an HTML file;

That takes a data structure of a Vector of Vectorized-Distinct-Colors and Vector of Dimension by Dimension Vecorized References to the preceding Vector Elements;
Then using the Count of the Vector Sequence and a Mapping and furthermore Maximum (As to allow a Dimension to be shorter than an entire Dimensions maximum measure [Which COULD be parsed as at either end and trunacated, by utilization of null as an element...], since default coloring and repetitions may futher increase these processes relevance...)
As a Width and Height determination procedure, and then looping positional reference map - and functional painting of color references upon a HTML5 Canvas...

Considering that JPEG, PNG, etc... (I believe MicroSofts' original BMP formats - even had "padding" [Regarding; either functional or not, anything outside of Colors and Positions referencing Colors, as Padding.]) each have such data within them - and since that is all needed to render and paint in this form...it begs the question; "Why not change it?"

No?
